How to use TensorFlow to process our own data?
The CIFAR10 dataset (binary version) is used in this code.

I used 10k training steps, learning rate is 0.05, the performance on test dataset is 78.3%.
While for the example on TensorFlow website, they used 100k training steps, got 83% on the test dataset.
More can be done to improve this model.
